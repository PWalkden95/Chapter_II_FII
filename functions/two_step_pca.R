### This is a script for a function that conducts the two-step PCA using the bird morphological
## traits. 

# INPUT: dataframe with species name and morphological traits.
#OUTPUT: dataframe with the three meaningful axes of variation: locomotory, forgaing and size niche


## the function can work with specimen data or just trait means. trait means just simple performs the 
## two-step PCA on the trait values while dealing with the specimen data the function attempts to fill
## in gaps in the specimen data (because it only takes full cases and we want to use as much of the information
## as possible). To do this the value is filled in as the mean of all other available specimens.
